    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/3 cup water</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, beat the egg. Mix the water into the beaten egg.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Create a well in the center of the mixture and slowly pour in the egg and water while mixing. Mix well. If the mixture is too dry, add additional water--one teaspoon at a time--until a pliable dough has formed.</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough until elastic. Cut dough into two separate balls. Cover the balls with a damp cloth, and let rest at room temperature for at least 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut each ball into four equal pieces. Each ball should be rolled out, relatively thin (around 1.5 mm is normal), and cut to a shape that suits what you intend to wrap. For instance, gyoza are well suited to a circular wrapper. Have fun with it!</li>
        <li>The sides of each individual wrapper may be lightly floured to prevent them from sticking to each other. Stacked, these may be wrapped in plastic and stored fresh or frozen.</li>
